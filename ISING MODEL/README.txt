**ISING MODEL**
HOW TO RUN:

Run the main.py script. It will ask if you want to do animation (Y/N)
Once you make the choice, input desired combinations of values leaving a space between each one
e.g. If for example you chose no animation (N) then inputting these: 50 10000 G
Will input an array size of 50 by 50, do 10000 sweeps and use the Glauber dynamics
For Kawasaki simply input K instead of G
